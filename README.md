# Currency Converter

This is the base project for the Coding4Fun Currency Converter for Windows Phone 7 application!

Currency Converter is a very simple application that is intended to show you how to quickly build WP7 app's with Silverlight, using an MVVM pattern for better maintainability!

Here you'll find all the code used in building this application, along with the updates that will be posted from here on!

If you want to know how the application works, head over to the Coding4Fun article: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/coding4fun/archive/2010/11/30/10098706.aspx

The application is free on Marketplace as well!

**Update:** a new version (v2) built for better performance and caching is now available; you can find the Coding4Fun development article at Channel9: http://channel9.msdn.com/coding4fun/articles/Currency-Converter-v2--Now-on-Caffeine
